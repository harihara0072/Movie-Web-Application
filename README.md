# Movie-Web-Application

This project is to develop a web application to get information about movies, their cast, their posters, etc. This application is developed using plain JavaScript and Ajax using the Web Services REST API called "The Movie DB" . Everything in this is done asynchronously as a result your web page should never be redrawn/refreshed completely. 

The application consists a text section where one can type a movie title (eg, The Matrix), one "Display Info" button to search, one section to display the search results, and one section to display information about a movie. The search results is an itemized clickable list of movie titles along with their years they were released. When you click on one of these movie titles, you display information about the movie: the poster of the movie as an image, the movie title, its genres (separated by comma), the movie overview (summary), and the names of the top five cast members (ie, actors who play in the movie).
